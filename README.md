This is a site that contains some data on how critics of games typically critique games you might enjoy.
This is a project that searches through a database of games to help discover if critics are unfair or biased
to certain genres of the game industry. Features include
 viewing games by rating across many critic sites, 
searching through distrbitors to find 
low prices, and comparing review averages across critic sites. Users
can also track games 
they like.

 The application was once functional, but there is no funding for database
hosting and the UI needs major work.
